# Statistical_Data_Analysis

<h2>Introduction to Statistical Data Analysis</h2>

<p>This repository contains coursework, exercises, and project work completed as part of the <strong>"Statistical Data Analysis"</strong> course under the Department of Computer Science.</p>

<h3>📌 Course Overview</h3>
<p>The course focused on building <strong>practical data analysis skills</strong> using programming. It combined theoretical foundations with hands-on work using real-world datasets.</p>

<h3>🎯 Key Learning Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand and explain core statistical concepts (variables, distributions, statistical testing)</li>
  <li>Manipulate and filter datasets programmatically</li>
  <li>Apply data summarization and visualization techniques for exploratory analysis</li>
  <li>Select appropriate statistical tests and justify their use</li>
  <li>Design and carry out end-to-end data analysis pipelines</li>
  <li>Interpret statistical findings in the context of real-world problems</li>
</ul>

<h3>🛠️ Topics Covered</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data wrangling and preprocessing</li>
  <li>Descriptive statistics and visualization</li>
  <li>Exploratory data analysis (EDA)</li>
  <li>Common hypothesis tests and their assumptions</li>
  <li>Real-world project implementation</li>
</ul>

<h3>🧪 Tools & Methods</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Programming-based data handling (Python/Pandas)</li>
  <li>Statistical testing and visualization (e.g., t-tests, chi-square, matplotlib/seaborn)</li>
  <li>Weekly exercises and a final data analysis project</li>
  <li>Total workload: ~135 hours including lectures, hands-on exercises, and project work</li>
</ul>
